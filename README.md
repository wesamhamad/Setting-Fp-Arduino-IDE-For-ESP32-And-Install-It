## What is ESP32 And The Advantages of using It Compared To Arduino Modules?
ESP32 is a series of low-cost power systems on a chip microcontroller. The ESP32 is an advanced version of the ESP8266 series. The ESP32 series is created and developed by Espressif Systems. The ESP32 have dual-core and Ultra low power co-processor. It was developed for the lack of security, which was in ESP8266

#### Advantages:  

- ESP32 offers you dual-core 160MHZ to 240MHZ.
- You can control and monitor your device with the help of Wi-fi or Bluetooth at a very low price.
- ESP32 offers you more GPIOs.
- ESP32 gives you a high speed of 150Mbps.
